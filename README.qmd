Choose your own adventure!

## vanilla-vite

In this directory is a vanilla JS project wrapped with Vite for easier playing around.

Read back through some of my [WebR Experiments](https://rud.is/webr-experiments/) if you need a Vite refresher. You can also just reorg the files/code a bit to serve it from a simple web server. However, I suggest changing to the directory and:

```bash
npm init
npm run dev
```

and then hacking away

## quarto

This is a Quarto document with the same basic structure. I didn't repeat the ggplot2 references, so look at the `index.html` in the `vanilla-vite` directory to see the ggplot2 references.
